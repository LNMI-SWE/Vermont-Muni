Vermont Query CLI â€” mini language

Fields (case-insensitive):
  town_id, town_name, county, population, square_mi, altitude,
  postal_code, office_phone, clerk_email, url

Operators:
  ==  !=  <  >  <=  >=  OF

Rules:
  - Fields/operators are case-insensitive; values are case-insensitive for this dataset.
  - Multi-word values require quotes (e.g., "South Burlington").
  - Only one AND or OR per query (no mixing), and OF cannot be combined with AND/OR.
  - OF town lookups are case-insensitive on town_name.

Examples:
  county == Lamoille
  county == "Grand Isle"
  altitude < 500 and population > 16000
  postal_code == 05401
  altitude OF Burlington

Commands:
  help     Show this help
  quit     Exit the program
